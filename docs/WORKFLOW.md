# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for stable releases
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<name>`
- Pull requests required for merging

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated build and test on push and PR
- Linting and code style checks
- Deployment to staging on merge to main
- Manual approval for production deploy

## Code Review Process
- All PRs require at least one review
- Use comments for suggestions and improvements
- Ensure tests and documentation are updated
- Follow contribution guidelines

## Issue Management
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- Label issues for priority and type
- Assign issues to contributors

## Release Process
- Update CHANGELOG.md for each release
- Tag releases in Git
- Announce major changes in README.md
