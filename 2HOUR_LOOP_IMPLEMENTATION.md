# 2-Hour Radar Loop Implementation

## Overview

Successfully converted the radar loop functionality from 6-hour synthetic timeline to a simplified 2-hour real-data timeline that matches the RainViewer API capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Core (weather-init-global.js)

**Removed:**

- `createExtended6HourTimeline()` function completely
- Synthetic frame generation logic
- 6-hour mode detection in `enableRainviewerTimeline()`
- Synthetic frame handling in `setRainviewerFrameByIndex()`

**Simplified:**

- `enableRainviewerTimeline()` now always uses natural 2-hour timeline from RainViewer API
- `setRainviewerFrameByIndex()` uses standard 70% opacity for all frames
- All frames use standard "© RainViewer" attribution

### 2. HTML Interface Updates

**weather-radar.html:**

- Changed ID from `rv-6h` to `rv-2h`
- Updated label from "6-hour loop" to "2-hour loop"
- Checkbox now defaults to checked (always enabled)
- Removed synthetic frame styling (italic, gray color)
- Removed "(Extended)" labels from frame dropdown

**modern-weather-radar.html:**

- Applied same changes as main weather app
- Consistent 2-hour loop UI across both interfaces

### 3. Visual Improvements

**Removed synthetic frame indicators:**

- No more "(Extended)" labels in frame dropdown
- No italic or gray styling for frames
- All frames appear with normal styling
- Consistent opacity and attribution

### 4. Testing

**Created test-2hour-loop.sh:**

- Validates 2-hour loop toggle presence
- Checks for removal of synthetic frame code
- Confirms RainViewer API integration
- Provides manual testing instructions

## Benefits of 2-Hour Loop

### 1. Real Data Only

- Uses actual radar data from RainViewer API
- No synthetic or repeated frames
- Accurate weather representation

### 2. Simplified Code

- Removed complex timeline extension algorithms
- Eliminated synthetic frame tracking
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

### 3. Better Performance

- No frame duplication or generation overhead
- Faster timeline loading
- More responsive UI

### 4. User Experience

- Clear, consistent frame labeling
- No confusion between real and synthetic data
- Reliable 2-hour radar loop that matches API capabilities

## API Limitations Acknowledged

- RainViewer public API provides ~2 hours of past radar data
- ~1 hour of nowcast/forecast data
- Total timeline typically 10-15 frames
- 2-hour loop represents realistic data availability

## Testing Instructions

1. Run: `bash test-2hour-loop.sh`
2. Open: <http://localhost:8082/public/weather-radar.html>
3. Verify "2-hour loop" checkbox is checked by default
4. Confirm frame dropdown shows real timestamps only
5. Test animation plays smoothly through available frames

## Success Criteria Met

✅ All synthetic frame code removed  
✅ 2-hour loop UI implemented  
✅ Real-time radar data only  
✅ Consistent frame styling  
✅ Simplified codebase  
✅ Both HTML interfaces updated  
✅ Test coverage provided  

The radar loop now accurately represents the ~2 hours of weather data available from the RainViewer public API, providing users with a realistic and reliable weather radar experience.
